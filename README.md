###The main problems of our teamwork:
1. Should add a Linter to the beginning of the development.
2. Some team members weren't answering in time when it was necessary to fix something urgently.
3. It was worth using "git flow" initially. 

### Min scope - **40**
- [ ] **10** **+10**  Main page + page with a list of authors + author's page (only html);
- [ ] **10** **+10**  Page with list of authors contains search widget;
- [ ] **20** **+20**  Portal has two languages;

### Normal scope - **130**
- [ ] **10** **+10**  Author's page contains timeline;
- [ ] **10** **+10**  Author's page contains video overlay;
- [ ] **20** **+20**   Author's page contains photo gallery;
- [ ] **10** **+10**   Author's page contains map (geowidget);
- [ ] **from 10 to 40** **+40**    Project is made using react (max 40 - if all widgets are done in React);
- [ ] **from 0 to 20** **+20**    Design;
- [ ] **20** **+20**   material-ui / bootstrap is used 

### Extra scope - **70**
- [ ] **10** **+?**    Confidence of the project presentation;
- [ ] **30** **+30**   Project is made using gatsbyjs;
- [ ] **20** **+20**   Contentful / netlify cms is used for content management
- [ ] **10** **+5**   Portal has third language;

### Fines
- **-100** **-0**    if there are less than 5 commits from each active team member. Everyone should merge their own PRs. 
- up to **-50** **-0**    points for violations
[stage2-tasks-requirements](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/docs/blob/master/ru/stage2-tasks-requirements.md)
- **-40** **-0**    if there is no worklog for team
- **-20** **-0**    too primitive (ugly for 2019) design / UX

mark calculation:
**Min scope scope:** +40 / 40
**Normal scope:** +125 / 130
**Extra scope:** +55 +?10 / 70
**Summary:** 40 + 130 + 55 + ?10 = 225 + ?10
**Maximum points:**  240
